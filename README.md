## Description

This project is a web application that predicts stress levels during sleep based on various sleep pattern features. It utilizes machine learning models to make predictions based on input data provided by the user. The web app is built using Flask for the backend and HTML/CSS for the frontend.

## Installation

To run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

- git clone https://github.com/your-username/stress-level-prediction.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:

- cd stress-level-prediction

3. Install the required dependencies:

- pip install -r requirements.txt


## Usage

1. Start the web app:

- python app.py

2. Open your web browser and navigate to:

- http://localhost:5000
3. Enter the sleep pattern features in the provided form and click "Predict" to get the stress level prediction.
